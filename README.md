# Call of Duty FOV Changer for Linux
This is a simple Field Of View Changer for Call of Duty.

# Install
git clone https://github.com/skudnu/cod_fov_changer  

Adjust your default FOV by going into src/main.cpp and change DEFAULT_FOV  

make

# Run
./cod_fov_changer

If you die, the setting `FOV` is resetting to its default value. Therefore you need to check cyclical if desired setting is still set.
